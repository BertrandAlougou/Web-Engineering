## Motion Design

Motion design is a creative discipline that uses **animation** and **visual effects** to bring static elements to life. It involves manipulating visual elements like **text**, **illustrations**, and **images** to create engaging and dynamic **motion graphics**.

The 3 Avengers of the web design world are:

- Videos
- Transitions
- Animations


### Videos

a video is worth a thousand pictures 
Videos have the magical ability of blending visuals, audio, motion and storytelling 



### Transitions 

 
Transitions smoothly guide us from one state to another, adding an extra layer of finesse 
Of course you do not always need to implement transitions. It depends on the style you are going for 

### Animations 

While similar to Transitions in the sense that they allow us to move from one state to another,
they are different in the sense that they allow us to create much complex movements than transitions

Exploring the Role of Motion on the Web 
- 
- Motion enhances the user experience
- Motion has 2 main purposes: Informative and Aesthetic 

1. ### Informative
- You can show users how to interact with the UI or even show them what actions are available.
- For example: On denis website, the buttons are animated on hover and tells the user that something will happen on clicking it
- Being informative, motion also has the ability of focusing a user's attention to something important 

2. ### Aesthetic
- For adding personality or character to your web project
- A good example will be a loading screen: dogstudio.co showcases this well
- Another example on denis website is how the rows of images shift positions on scroll 

# REMEMBER

- You can use motion design in a bunch of places like film titles, user interfaces, advertisements and videos
- When it comes to the web, we can add motion by using videos, transitions and animations 
- Videos can deliver information in a very dynamic and effective way because they're a blend of visuals, audio, motion, and storytelling
