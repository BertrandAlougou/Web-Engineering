 # DOM (Document Object Model)
 
The DOM is the structural representation of your html  document.
It can be though of a tree of nodes or elements created by the Browser.


JS can be used to manipulate the DOM and its elements 
The DOM is object-oriented meaning that each node has its own properties and methods 
that we can change , remove and manipulate using JS. Jquery was used to achieve this for a long time but today we can achieve that with vanilla javascript

The Browser gives us a window object (*Document*) which represents the browser itself. It's the top-level object 
And then we have the *Root element* which is the html tag or element or node and inside that we have children like the head and body nodes or elements or tags, and they have their own elements like *tags, href, title*
and those elements have text nodes and attributes.
